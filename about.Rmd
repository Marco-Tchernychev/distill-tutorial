## About Me
My name is **Marco Tchernychev**, I go to Brookline High School.

## About the Project
My project, *The Fuel Efficiency of cars*, compares the fuel efficiency of cars to their weight.

### Goals
* Educate people on how to be more environmentally conscious.

  + A complication for this goal is that it might be difficult to get this graphic shown to enough people.

* Practice my R Studio skills!
